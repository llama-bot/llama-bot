# Contribution guide

## Purpose

There are several goals this guide aims to achieve:

- Help new contributors get started
- Prevent information fragmentation as people work on different parts of the software
- Streamline the development workflow
- Make things work in the project owner's absence
- Minimize intervention and back-and-forth communication (e.g. The contributor didn't format their code properly)

## Assumptions

All contributors are assumed to be familiar with the following:

- git (and by extension github and developer collaboration)
- node.js and its ecosystem (npm packages, yarn, etc.)
- javascript and typescript
- code formatting

## Getting started

### Development environment

Contributors are free to use whatever IDE they want but the usage of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is highly recommended.

Format markdown file(s) with [prettier](https://prettier.io) formatter

## Commit message

The commit message should be a clear and concise description of what the commit does.
The first line should be no more than 50 characters and the rest no more than 72.

## Updating command

A usage guide for a command exists in two places.
One's in the command's source code itself and the other is in the documentation page.
When a command is updated, both sources should not be in conflict.
